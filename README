I "ported" this from Joel Hooks' Signal command map from: https://github.com/joelhooks/signals-extensions-CommandSignal to work with the current Robotlegs2.

I would love to get some help on the guards and hooks aspect. I have taken a quick stab at it but I think I might be missing the way to unmap properly for "one times". 
It works jsut fine for what I need in my current RL application to upgrade it to RL2. Any input is highly appreciated!

There is a simple example at: https://github.com/pixels4nickels/SignalCommandMap-example
