I "ported" this from Joel Hooks' Signal command map from:  to work with the current Robotlegs2.

I would love to get some help on making this right. I have taken a quick stab at it but I think I might be missing a few things. 
It works for what I need in my current RL application to upgrade it to RL2. Any input is highly appreciated!

There is a simple example at: https://github.com/pixels4nickels/SignalCommandMap-example
